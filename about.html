					<h1>Who am I?</h1>
					<p>
						I'm Jared! I am an AWS DevSecOps developer with four years of experience, and three years spent in a sysadmin and security role. I really enjoy automating manual processes, and creating pipelines and infrastructure from scratch.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my spare time I enjoy racing my car, playing jazz trombone, and many outdoor activities. I especially enjoy camping in the summer, and skating on the Rideau Canal in the winter.
					</p>
					<h3>What Have I Done?</h3>
					<p>
						I have worked on many projects, but these are the ones I am most proud of.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/Autocross-Timer/autocross-timer">Autocross timer</a></b>: a website for autocross live timing, built with a VueJS frontend and Go backend. I am building this for my local motorsports club, MCO. It is currently in development, but building and deploying is fully automated.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/kfarwell/assassins.tech">Assassins.TECH</a></b>: a twist on the classic game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_(game)">Assassin</a> using SMS text messaging, built entirely in Bash. It was made by Kyle Farwell and I, and it won 2nd place at the <a href="https://thacks2.devpost.com/">THacks 2</a> Hackathon.
