					<h1>Who am I?</h1>
					<p>
						I'm Jared! I am a computer science enthusiast who has been programming for almost ten years. My main focus is on software development, however currently I am working in a system administration role doing a lot of scripting and generating reports on the state of the server environment. It is something I find myself enjoying more and more as I get more experience in system administration, and I now consider it an interest of mine.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my spare time I enjoy programming for fun, as well as reading and listening to and playing music as a member of the Algoma University Jazz Band. Arduinos are a passion of mine, and I enjoy tinkering around with them and various pieces of hardware. If its electronic, I've probably broken or fixed it at some point.
					</p>
					<h3>What Have I Done?</h3>
					<p>
						I have many projects that I work on, be it for school, fun, or at a hackathon with friends.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the biggest ones is Assassins.TECH, a twist on the classic game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_(game)">Assassin</a> using SMS text messaging. It was made by Kyle Farwell and I, and it won 2nd place at the <a href="http://thacks.tech/">THacks 2</a> Hackathon.
					</p>
					<h3>Who Are My Friends?</h3>
					<p>
						A few of the people who I have worked with along the way.

								Keefer is someone I met through Kyle. We have discussed making games together with <a class="friendslink" href="https://gelatolabs.xyz/">Gelato Labs</a>, but have yet to actually do anything. We've only met in person twice, but one day we may meet again.
